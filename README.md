# SpaceTraders.Unity
An implementation of spacetraders.io in Unity

# Goals
1. Implement the [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io) in Unity
2. Learn how to use [UnityWebRequest](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Networking.UnityWebRequest.html)
3. Learn how to use [UI Toolkit](https://unity.com/features/ui-toolkit)

# Extras
